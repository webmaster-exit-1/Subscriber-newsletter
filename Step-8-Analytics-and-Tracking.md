Step 8: Analytics and Tracking

In this step, we'll integrate analytics and tracking features to measure the performance of newsletters and gather valuable insights. We'll track open rates, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics.

Here's an example of how you can implement analytics and tracking:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlencode

def generate_tracking_link(subscriber_id, newsletter_id, link):
    tracking_params = {
        'subscriber_id': subscriber_id,
        'newsletter_id': newsletter_id
    }
    tracking_query = urlencode(tracking_params)
    tracking_link = f"http://example.com/track?{tracking_query}&url={link}"
    return tracking_link

def process_tracking_request(subscriber_id, newsletter_id):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("UPDATE newsletter_subscribers SET opened_at = ? WHERE subscriber_id = ? AND newsletter_id = ?",
              (datetime.now(), subscriber_id, newsletter_id))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def send_newsletter_with_tracking(newsletter_id):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM newsletters WHERE id = ?", (newsletter_id,))
    newsletter = c.fetchone()

    if newsletter:
        subject, body, _, scheduled_at = newsletter
        subscribers = get_subscribed_subscribers()

        for subscriber in subscribers:
            subscriber_id, email, name, _, _ = subscriber
            tracking_pixel_url = generate_tracking_link(subscriber_id, newsletter_id, '')
            tracking_pixel = f'<img src="{tracking_pixel_url}" width="1" height="1" alt="">'
            personalized_body = body.replace('{name}', name)
            personalized_body += tracking_pixel
            email_config.send_email(subject, personalized_body, [email])
            c.execute("INSERT INTO newsletter_subscribers (newsletter_id, subscriber_id, sent_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                      (newsletter_id, subscriber_id, datetime.now()))

        conn.commit()
        print(f"Newsletter {newsletter_id} sent to {len(subscribers)} subscribers with tracking.")
    else:
        print(f"Newsletter {newsletter_id} not found.")

    conn.close()

def get_newsletter_analytics(newsletter_id):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_subscribers WHERE newsletter_id = ?", (newsletter_id,))
    total_sent = c.fetchone()[0]
    c.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_subscribers WHERE newsletter_id = ? AND opened_at IS NOT NULL", (newsletter_id,))
    total_opened = c.fetchone()[0]
    conn.close()

    open_rate = (total_opened / total_sent) * 100 if total_sent > 0 else 0
    return {
        'total_sent': total_sent,
        'total_opened': total_opened,
        'open_rate': open_rate
    }
```

In this example, we introduce tracking functionality and analytics:

- `generate_tracking_link(subscriber_id, newsletter_id, link)`: This function generates a unique tracking link for each subscriber and newsletter combination. It appends tracking parameters (`subscriber_id` and `newsletter_id`) to the provided `link` URL.

- `process_tracking_request(subscriber_id, newsletter_id)`: This function is called when a tracking link is clicked or a tracking pixel is loaded. It updates the `opened_at` timestamp in the `newsletter_subscribers` table to record the opening of the newsletter by the subscriber.

- `send_newsletter_with_tracking(newsletter_id)`: This function sends the newsletter with tracking capabilities. It includes a tracking pixel in the newsletter body, which is a small transparent image with a unique tracking URL. When the newsletter is opened and the tracking pixel is loaded, it triggers the `process_tracking_request()` function to record the opening event.

- `get_newsletter_analytics(newsletter_id)`: This will retrieve the analytics data for the newsletter with ID 1 and print the total sent, total opened, and open rate.

With the `get_newsletter_analytics()` function completed, you now have a way to retrieve and analyze the performance metrics of your newsletters.
