 Chris Titus Tech - Newsletter
This has been a long time coming, but after months of work, this newsletter is operational and independent of ANY platform. I'll go into the details of sending out over 12,000+ emails independently below for those who want to geek out. 

You may have signed up years ago or recently, but if you do NOT want to receive future emails from me [click here](http://newsletter.christitus.com/unsubscribe/JNln9MHMLZQnMrWXLPnVKCUzWvPQsD0wGbF9892TcKCT3awup763lgM9wHNyegRUbuJA/BdlkPnowdu7nhx6niCzQUw/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg).

Chris Titus Changes
New Logo

Designed by John Xionidis and I love the shield design incorporating CTT in a new way.
New releases of Windows Toolbox
These have moved up to Monthly releases and are done live on [twitch.tv/christitustech](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/BdlkPnowdu7nhx6niCzQUw/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg)
Adding C programming
DWM is a barebones window manager made in C. I've had a blast learning C and making this into my ["Ultimate System"](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg). This will continue to be developed and one day I hope to have it beginner-friendly with scripts to adjust to your system on the fly. You can track the project here: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dwm-titus
C# programming is being worked on for a side project of Winutil. I hate how the exe wrapper for the people who donate still uses PowerShell commands. I've started programming Winoneshot with all C# and .Net libraries that use the Winutil JSON configuration files to apply the tweaks completely independent of Powershell. I have no ETA on the first draft of this, but all the backend is done and now I just have to code the frontend GUI for everyone to use. That said, the Powershell version is not going ANYWHERE! I just want to offer more to those who have supported me through its development. Thank you all!
Remodeled Studio
Over 30 days of downtime a massive undertaking, but we have finished! This was such a relief to get through and if you have ever accumulated a massive amount of junk in a room or garage... this was what the studio became after 5 years of content creation. No longer! The redesign was successful and the space feels so much better, check out the video here: [Studio Redesign](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/q5C8eq4WquTrXjo54f7wtA/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg)
What is Happening and Common Questions
Q: Is there a Chris Titus Tech Discord?
A: No, I've attempted these in the past and they end up taking up too much time and moderation can be difficult.
Q: You are back on Thorium!?!
A: Yes, the dev made a post [here](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/892JFHMXgwGEyuGCBazrmglQ/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg) and said that he has addressed all the issues. He is young and made a mistake with the inclusion of the offending content. I still love his work and the browser is something unique in today's bloated world. It is stripped down and fast, which is what I want. Here is my video on it: [The Best Web Browser](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/kPhXC5Q763q3BpViIJNsRRew/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg)
Q: More Videos or Live Streams?
A: Both. The purpose of taking February off was to figure out what areas work and what doesn't. Live streams are a great way for people to see the start and depth of a project that a 10-minute YouTube video can't. Having them complete each other with the live streams being time-stamped and uploaded to Titus Tech Talk YouTube channel is great. However, chopping up clips and bite-sized hot takes isn't something I'm good at. There might be a few clips here and there, but a majority of [Titus Tech Talk](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/ZFGTpU54tTLXcCP5jyOhTQ/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg) will be the edited streams for a main channel video that is 10-20 minutes in length. 
Q: Christitus.com Posts
A: I haven't been focusing on a lot of big projects that require a website guide these past 6 months. However, I have a lot of things queued up that would benefit from a cheat sheet or guide coming up and I will get back to producing more articles directly on my website. Everything posted here is done by me and I do not accept any sponsored or brand posts. I write everything end to end and host it myself. 
Q: YouTube's Future?
A: YouTube has been pushing shorts a lot and it is just something I hate. It's what led me to make ["How to Remove YouTube Shorts"](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/HoBaDvuPYD2WRY0JdlP9Og/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg). Going forward, I just want to make the projects I enjoy and do videos on that. If it excites me and is interesting I'll make a video! Any sponsored videos I take on are dedicated and can be skipped if it doesn't interest you, but these are rare. Doing ad spots and integrations is something I don't enjoy and why they aren't in any of my videos.
Windows Utility Project
This project has over 10,000 daily users now and is the #2 Active Powershell Github Project in the WORLD! #1 is Scoop package manager... which is insane. This has been a massive growing experience as I've learned how to manage hundreds of contributors and code that comes in daily now. The primary focus for this past month and going forward is refactoring for simplicity and improving its documentation. The last pull request was done on March 21st and I moved a bunch of dynamic elements users were having to process on their local machine to a compile script on GitHub so it would be offloaded during the creation process. This makes Winutil launch faster and is less taxing at runtime for any user. 

There is still a lot to do on the project and reviewing the code for bugs and optimizations are my top priorities for this next development cycle. The top two improvements for the next update are MicroWin run space improvements for speed and documenting its structure. If you want to support the project you can buy an EXE wrapper @ https://www.cttstore.com/windows-toolbox

Email Technical Breakdown
This is more for those who are interested in the business of email marketing. Sites like MailChimp, Constant Contact, and many many more can get insanely expensive to use after about 1000 users. I had been using my digital download provider to send out newsletters last year, but they switched to a pay-to-play plan that made it hundreds of dollars to send emails per month. This had left me no option but to build out a platform myself as the cheapest I could find was MailChimp and the cost to send out a monthly newsletter came in around $500 per month. INSANE! 

I've set up many mail servers in the past, but it gets very tricky when sending to thousands of people at once and following all laws globally. Unsubscribe notices and GPDR among other issues will pop up when doing it yourself. This is why I found an off-the-shelf solution called [Sendy](http://newsletter.christitus.com/l/gYDxxsGVTYUNWR7630JzEA8g/AUkbNhq55jCFJm5HN5AI9A/FQlw9bdgPiun16hJCdj763lg). It allows me to have all the needed formatting for an email, unsubscribe lists, GPDR compliance, and tie-in to AWS SES services that charge a minimal cost per 1000 emails sent. Roughly $0.10 per thousand. It still requires creating an HTML page for sign-ups, unsubscribe notices, and other newsletter things, but it is extremely well done. It also requires knowledge of DNS, Web hosting, and some HTML programming. 

Feedback
Going forward this newsletter will be a recap of monthly technology news, exciting things that are coming up, and anything else that will be of value to you! I'll always be respectful of your email inbox and if there isn't anything to report... you won't see a newsletter from me. However, enough happens in a month that I should be able to get this out every 30 days or so. If you need to get a hold of me send me a response to contact@christitus.com. I've gone full boomer mode on communication and found email the best form that I can check a couple of times a day so it doesn't interfere with my day-to-day operations and projects.

Thank you all,
